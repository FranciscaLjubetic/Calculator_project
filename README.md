# Calculator_project

This is a tutorial-like project to put hands on what classes, interfaces, data structures and lambdas are in Java.

To watch it, you should run the main outside the packages, although every package has its own mini-main (of course, the best is to erase them,
but they´re so useful to test everything, while I´m still working).

I decided to keep some methods with traditional notation and not as lambdas, to get some feedback about the best practices 
and to polish my factoring skills.
